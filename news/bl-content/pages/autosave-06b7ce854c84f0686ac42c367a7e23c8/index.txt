<p>Shib City (12/4/20XX) , the place where the koleon cult strikes, a peaceful medium city gobernated by Sheeb, everyone is living a happy life and everything seems fine! Until one day, a certain citizen notices something sketchy going on, he sees sheeb going into [REDACTED], which is weird for a politician, he follows it and sees something he shouldn't have, a gun shot is heard. Sheeb notices the citizen behind him and calls his guards to put the blame on him, the citizen runs away safely, but not after sheeb has made him an enemy of the state. The citizen was dissapointed at the goverment they had, and wanted a change. He got contacts and planned things for a while... until right now, 26/03/2021, something is cooking. And the citizen has to do with it.</p>
